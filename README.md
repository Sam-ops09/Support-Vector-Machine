## Introduction

Support Vector Machines is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. SVM is based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

## Dependencies

The code in this repository is written in Python 3. It uses the following dependencies:

- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this code, simply clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sam-ops09/Support-Vector-Machine.git
```

Then navigate to the cloned directory and run the desired Python file. For example:

```
cd Support-Vector-Machine
python svm_classification.py
```

## Support Vector Machines

The repository contains two examples of SVM implementation:

1. SVM Classification: This example shows how to implement SVM for classification analysis. It uses a dataset of iris flowers and classifies them into three different species.

2. SVM Regression: This example shows how to implement SVM for regression analysis. It uses a dataset of housing prices and predicts the prices based on different features.

## Conclusion

Support Vector Machines is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. The implementation of SVM using Scikit-learn in Python is straightforward and easy to use. This repository provides code examples for SVM implementation, which can be used as a starting point for more complex projects.
